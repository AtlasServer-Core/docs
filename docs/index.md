## What is AtlasServer?

AtlasServer is a local deployment platform designed for developers who need to quickly share demos of their applications without complex cloud setups. It provides a centralized dashboard to manage, launch, and expose your Flask, FastAPI, and Django applications on your local network or to the internet via secure tunnels like Ngrok.

## Key Features

- **Fast Local Deployment**: Launch your applications with a single click through an intuitive web interface
- **Framework Support**: Deploy Flask, FastAPI, and Django applications (with Next.js and more coming in premium version)
- **LAN & Internet Exposure**: Share your applications on your local network or expose them securely via Ngrok
- **Process Management**: Start, stop, restart, and monitor your running applications
- **Real-time Logs**: View application logs directly in the dashboard
- **Multi-user Support**: Manage access with different user roles and permissions
- **Command Line Interface**: Manage your server and applications through a powerful CLI
- **Secure By Design**: Keep your development environment under your control, not in the cloud
- **Python virtual environment**: Add Python virtual environment auto-detection

## Who is it for?

- **Freelancers**: Quickly demonstrate work to clients without complex deployments
- **Agencies**: Streamline the client approval process with easy-to-share demos
- **Development Teams**: Simplify internal testing and collaboration
