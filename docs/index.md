## What is AtlasServer?

AtlasServer is a local deployment platform designed for developers who need to quickly share demos of their applications without complex cloud setups. It provides a centralized dashboard to manage, launch, and expose your Flask and FastAPI applications (with more frameworks coming soon) on your local network or to the internet via secure tunnels like Ngrok.

## Key Features

- **Fast Local Deployment**: Launch your applications with a single click through an intuitive web interface
- **Framework Support**: Deploy Flask and FastAPI applications (with Django, Next.js, and more coming soon)
- **LAN & Internet Exposure**: Share your applications on your local network or expose them securely via Ngrok
- **Process Management**: Start, stop, restart, and monitor your running applications
- **Real-time Logs**: View application logs directly in the dashboard
- **Multi-user Support**: Manage access with different user roles and permissions
- **Secure By Design**: Keep your development environment under your control, not in the cloud

## Who is it for?

- **Freelancers**: Quickly demonstrate work to clients without complex deployments
- **Agencies**: Streamline the client approval process with easy-to-share demos
- **Development Teams**: Simplify internal testing and collaboration
- **Educators**: Share working examples with students or colleagues
- **Startup Founders**: Test MVPs with stakeholders before investing in cloud infrastructure
